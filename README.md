# Trade Hub

Personal trading dashboard for crypto and forex: live prices, 14-day candlestick charts, a 21-pattern detector, and personal strategy + watchlist notes. Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind v4. No backend — market data is proxied through Next.js route handlers (free-tier CoinGecko + ExchangeRate API), and user state lives in `localStorage`.

## Commands

All project operations go through the `Makefile`. Run `make help` for the full list.
